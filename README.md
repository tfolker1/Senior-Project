# Task Scheduling Algorithm in Cloudsim

We developed a task scheduling algorithm using the Cloudsim package, written in Java, that combines FCFS scheduling with a variation of suffrage. 

## Instructions
In order to execute the code, it is required that Cloudsim is installed on your machine.

There are 2 files in this repository. ExtendedExample.java is the file that initiates the simulation and runs the scheduling algorithm. After downloading this file, it must be placed in examples/org.cloudbus.cloudsim.examples. The other file, DatacenterBroker.java, holds our scheduling algorithm and all of its helper algorithms. This file must be placed in sources/org.cloudbus.cloudsim. You can now return to ExtendedExample.java and execute the code.
